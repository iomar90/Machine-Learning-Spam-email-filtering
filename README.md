Spam Filtering using Na√Øve Bayesian classifier

In Spam filtering problem the examples or observations are the emails, and the features are the words in the email. When using words as features we suppose that some words are more likely to appear in spam than in non-spam, which is the basic premise underlying most spam filters.  
The attached folder contains three files:
1.	Spmabase.Documentation: has all the information about the dataset
a.	Source
b.	Number of examples (instances or observations)
c.	Number of attributes
d.	Attributes information
2.	Spambase.names: has the names of the features, and the target
3.	Spambase.data: contains the dataset
Write a Python code to: 
1.	train a Bayesian classifier to classify emails to spam email or non-spam email. 
a.	Divide the dataset to a training set and a testing set. 
b.	Train the classifier on the training set, and test the classifier on the testing set, 
c.	use 70% of the dataset as a training and 30% of the data as testing.  
2.	Calculate the accuracy of the classifier.
